# Ironhack Java Challenges

## Goal

This activity is focused on gaining experience by doing exercises. Remember, practice makes perfect so try to do your best to solve the following challenges. If you get stuck, you can always go back to the previously covered lessons or do a Google search.

## Challenge 1: Find Maximum

Write a method maximum that returns the largest integer in the list. You can assume that the list has at least one element.
```java
public Integer maximum(Integer[] numList) { 
 // enter your code here 
}
```

## Challenge 2: Print number in word
Write a program called `printNumberInWord` which prints "ONE", "TWO",... , "NINE", "OTHER" if the int variable "number" is 1, 2,... , 9, or other, respectively. Use:
  (a) a "nested-if" statement;
  (b) a "switch-case-default" statement.
  ```java
public String printNumberInWord(int num) {
 // enter your code here
}
```

## Challenge 3: Check Odd/Even

Write a method called `checkOddEven` which prints "Odd Number" if the int variable “number” is odd, or “Even Number” otherwise.
Hint n is an even number if (n % 2) is 0; otherwise, it is an odd number. Use == for comparison, e.g., (n % 2) == 0.
```java
public void checkOddEven(int num) { 
 // enter your code here 
}
```


## Challenge 4: Calculate the average
Write a method average that returns the average of the integer in the list. You can assume that the list has at least one element.
```java
public double average(Integer[] numList) { 
 // enter your code here 
}
```
